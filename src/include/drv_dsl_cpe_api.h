   Trellis config/status value.

   Some common standard related notes about the Trellis configuration option
   - In case of ADSL1 Trellis could be only configured for both directions
     (US/DS) together. This is done by exchanging the information within
     handshake procedure between CO<->CPE, means both sides are indicating
     whether they support Trellis or not. If both sides supports it, it will be
     done without any additional condition. If one side does not support it, it
     will be NOT done.
   - In case of ADSL2/2+ and VDSL2 Trellis could be configured for both
     directions independently but the responsibility for each direction is
     assigned as follows
     - Downstream can be configured by ATU-R only
     - Upstream can be configured by ATU-C only

   Resulting handling of Trellis configuration within CPE API context:
   - Trellis configuration can be only changed for DS.
     In case of using ioctl \ref DSL_FIO_LINE_FEATURE_CONFIG_SET and nDirection
     equals DSL_UPSTREAM the configuration value for trellis is ignored.
   - In case of ADSL1 it depends on the CO configuration whether trellis is
     activated or not according to above description. This could lead to the
     effect that trellis(ds) is enabled but not used if status is requested
     via ioctl \ref DSL_FIO_LINE_FEATURE_STATUS_GET.
   - In case of ADSL2/2+ and VDSL2 the configuration value that is used for
     trellis(ds) should be directly reflected within according downstream status
     value provided by ioctl \ref DSL_FIO_LINE_FEATURE_STATUS_GET. */
